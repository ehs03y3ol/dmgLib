# dmgLib
A bunch of simple ideas for a JavaScript Library to help vintage-like Game Development.

Basically I want to make some functions to imitate the old dot matrix (you know witch one) screen, audio and colission instruction set.

This is not yet OpenSource and Collaboration is closed. I am a begginer developer and I want to take care of all stages.

## About dmgLib Screen Implementation

Constants vertical resolution and horizontal resolution.

It can be easy implement a multidimensional. 

Every horizontal resolution could have a especial number to execute the horizontal sync, wich can comunicate with the software to handle this timing.

As horizontal sync, vertical resolution will have own VSync signal.

I going to need 4 colors for every grid.  Every color represents one of four shade's of green. But it could be interesting using also reduced colors like dot Matrix Game Color.

## About dmgLib Audio Implementation

I don't know anything about software synths. But there are out a good library out there tone.js It should be able to use all the audio capabilities of DMG.

## About dmgLib Collisions

TBA.
